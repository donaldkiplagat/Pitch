## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Live site can be accessed from the following link https://newshighlight-donald.herokuapp.com/

### Known Bugs

The panels are sometimes irregular due to different image/description sizes.

### Behaviour Driven Development

Given: Sources are available<br>
When: A source is chosen<br>
Then: Articles from that source are shown<br>

* The program should display images related to the articles<br>
Given:A source is chosen<br>
When: Articles section loads <br>
Then: Images should be displayed<br>


### Technologies Used
