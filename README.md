## Description
This web-app allows the user to choose news from a particular source and view the articles within that source.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Live site can be accessed from the following link https://newshighlight-donald.herokuapp.com/


### Known Bugs
Some sources have no news thus the page will be blank.
The panels are sometimes irregular due to different image/description sizes.

### Behaviour Driven Development
* The program should return a source's articles when chosen.<br>
Given: Sources are available<br>
When: A source is chosen<br>
Then: Articles from that source are shown<br>

* The program should display images related to the articles<br>
Given:A source is chosen<br>
When: Articles section loads <br>
Then: Images should be displayed<br>


### Technologies Used
* Atom was the source code editor of choice.
* Git and Github were used as my local and online repositories respectively.
* Flask was used as the micro-framework
* Heroku was used in deploying the live site


### Support and contact details
